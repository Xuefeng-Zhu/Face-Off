## Overview
CS 467 "Quantified Selfie" Implementation Write-upGoal/Motivation: Everyone has their opinions about themselves. In our Quantified Selfie project, we will visualize how our views of ourselves compare with how others view us. We chose to focus on the four factors that people seem to notice the most while learning more about their friends and acquaintances - social skills, intelligence, niceness and organization. Audience: This visualization might appeal to anyone who is interested in learning about how others view him/her in society. It is meant to be an introspective and interesting mode of feedback regarding oneself. 

## Questions

1.	I think I come across as a nice person to most people, is this true?
2. I am completely capable of balancing 18+ hours of workload while also working part-time. Do others also believe I'm this organized? 
3. I deserve to graduate summa cum laude. Do my peers agree? How about my relatives? How about my other Facebook friends who I don't speak to that much? 
4. I don't think I'm very social. I tend to keep to myself most of the time, especially at large gatherings. What do others think? Where do I stand comparatively?
	## Approach/Data 
Send invites to select Facebook friends to take the survey and the results are analyzed anonymously.  The visualization is a bar graph of two bars for each category, one representing my personal answers, and the other bar representing the averaged ratings based on the survey feedback. These two bars placed adjacently clearly depicts the story we are trying to tell. ##Tools
